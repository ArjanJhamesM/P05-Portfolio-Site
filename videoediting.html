            Representing our batch through videos
        </h2>

        <p class="hobby-page-full-description">
            Tiles Productions is the video production company established by Arjan Jhames Manzano in 2022. 
            Its roots can be traced back to a performance video of Manzano’s section, which Tiles Productions has taken charge of.
            It has become the forefront production company of his batch, representing his classmates to his school community.
            It strives to deliver videos capturing the essence of the videos’ subject, all while embodying the prowess of its crew.
            Tiles Productions’ signature “farewell videos” exemplify this aim. 
            These videos are the reflection of the company’s creative minds and, ultimately, mementos for Manzano’s batch to keep.
            All Tiles Productions projects–farewell videos and more–conform to the company’s meticulous production process.
            In each video, the editing expertise of the company is realized. 
            Tiles Productions has been acclaimed for the marvel it brings in terms of the scale and technicality of each video.

            For two years and counting, I have distilled the spirit our batch into these videos:

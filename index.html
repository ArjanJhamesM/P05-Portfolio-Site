    <h1>ARJAN JHAMES A. MANZANO</h1>

    <p>
        With a fiery passion for technology, I delve into anything and everything computers. A tinkerer at heart, I've taken some of them apart throughout the years. I'm also adept when it comes to their software, as I grew up using computers. My affinity and exposure at an early age to computers molded me to the well-versed geek I am today.
